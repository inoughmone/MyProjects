Label  : REGR - Repository Browser dislpays an entity attbribute as "Entity Attribute"
Description :                                     
	 Regression BUG:(seeCR# 234493)  Repository browser displays entity attributes with a name of "Entity Attribute", if you double click the entity attribute, in the Repository Object Properties window the NAME/CODE fields are empty. Note: The first attribute of each entity displays correctly, but all subsequent attributes display the described behavior.  This is reproducable only when repository tables reside on a Ms Sql Server 2000 database.  NOTE:  I cannot reproduce on Sybase ASE 12.5, ASA 7.0.x, ASA8.0.x or Oracle 8.1.7 dbms...  Tested using either of the following ODBC drivers: Microsoft Sql Server                                                                          v. 2000.81.9001.00      SQLSRV32.dll      2/19/2002 PB DataDirect OEM 4.10 32-BIT Sql Server Wire Protocol  v. 4.10.00.00                  PBMSSS18.dll     2/15/2002 PB DataDirect OEM 4.10 32-BIT Sql Server                              v. 4.10.00.00                  PBSS618.dll         2/15/2002   To reproduce: 1. Consolidate (no auto extract) the sample  "project.cdm" file to a Ms Sql Server 2000 database. 2. In Repository browser, select the Entity folder > select a specified entity and expand it's tree.  You will see entity attributes listed as "Entity Attribute" and not it's given name. 3. Double click a entity attribute that is displayed as "Entity Attribute" to get it's properties window.  You will see it's Name and Code entries are empty.  NOTE: it appears to only be a display issue in the Repository. Because, when you extract the model and view it in the workspace window, the list of entity attributes are displayed and listed correctly.

	 Customer is trying to copy tigger templates from a db2 v7 os/390 dbms to as400 dbms. After copying the trigger templates to AS/400, PD shutsdown in 9.5.1.EBF3  Steps to reproduce:  1. Create new PDM (Target DB2v7 OS/390, COPY TO MODEL). 2. Create a second PDM (Target AS/400, COPY TO MODEL). 3. Select the DB2 model. 4. Click Database -> Edit Current DBMS 5. Select the AS/400 model. 6. Click Database -> Edit Current DBMS (You should now have 2 DBMS Properties dialog boxes.) (Note that, in the AS/400 dialog box, the Trigger Templates and Trigger Template Items tab are empty.  The idea is to copy the items from the DB2 definition.) 7. Select the DB2 dialog box. 8. Select the Trigger Templates tab. Highlight all templates (should be 6). 9. Ctrl-C to copy into the clipboard. 10. Select the AS/400 dialog box. 11. Select the Trigger Templates tab. 12. Click your mouse in the first Name cell, auto-creating "Template_1".  (This is important!) 13. Press Ctrl-V to paste the 6 templates.  You will see 7 "Template_1" items appear, then PowerDesigner shuts down. (This occurs under 9.5.1 only.) In 9.5.2, the trigger templates are pasted with the correct names.  For the customer, the GPF occurred immediately. For TSE, they needed to change focu to a different application and then the GPF occurred.

	 \\neo\cir\...314569  In the customer's model is a table and a stored procedure that references the table.  When Modify Database is executed, both the table and stored procedure are dropped, but the stored procedure is recreated first.  This results in a database error when the modify script is executed against the database because the stored procedure needs to reference the table that has not been recreated.  Steps to reproduce: 1. Open the model customer's model 2. insert a new column, customer_loc, as the third column in Table_1 3. Open the procedure and make a change(change customer_id = 1002 to 1003) . 4. Execute modify database and select the archive model. 5. In the resulting sql file you will see that the create or replace procedure statement comes before the actual creation of the table.   Note: If the 'one file' option is deselected, the source sql file correctly calls the create table script first and then the stored procedure script.

Label  : Maximum of 8 PK columns reversed for ASE 12.5 via ODBC
Description :                                                
	 When reverse engineering ASE 12.5 via ODBC, only the first 8 columns of the primary key are reverse engineered properly. Column 9 and beyond of the PK are reverse engineered, but not as primary keys.  This appears to be a limitation set in the Key\SqlListQuery item in the DBMS file.  The index_col value stops at 8 index columns.  As a workaround, add additional lines of  'index_col('[%CATALOG%..]%TABLE%',i.indid,8,u.uid)+','+ ' ensuring that the number value is incremented appropriately.  To reproduce: Generate the following to ASE 12.5 and then reverse engineer via ODBC.  create table TEST (      COLUMN_1        CHAR(10)             not null,      COLUMN_2        CHAR(10)             not null,      COLUMN_3        CHAR(10)             not null,      COLUMN_4        CHAR(10)             not null,      COLUMN_5        CHAR(10)             not null,      COLUMN_6        CHAR(10)             not null,      COLUMN_7        CHAR(10)             not null,      COLUMN_8        CHAR(10)             not null,      COLUMN_9        CHAR(10)             not null,      COLUMN_10       CHAR(10)             not null,      COLUMN_11       CHAR(10)             not null,      COLUMN_12       CHAR(10)             null,      COLUMN_13       CHAR(10)             null ) go  alter table TEST    add constraint PK_TEST primary key (COLUMN_1, COLUMN_2, COLUMN_3, COLUMN_4, COLUMN_5, COLUMN_6, COLUMN_7, COLUMN_8, COLUMN_9, COLUMN_10, COLUMN_11) go

Description :                                               
	 The modified extended attribute value fails to be flagged as changed when consolidating the a model.  This occurs only if the model has been extracted from the repository and then the XEM is associated with the model.  If you create a new model, associate the XEM, change a value and then consolidate, the value change is saved.  To reproduce: 1) Open project.pdm, then consolidate and extract it. (Any models in repository that do not have an Extended Model Defintion(XEM) attached could be used as well.)   2) Import the PowerBuilder XEM. 3) Select the extended attributes tab on the properties window of the employee table. 4) For the LabelFont attribute, change the font size from '10' to '25' 5) Consolidate project.pdm in update mode Note: The only change that has been flagged is the addition of the PowerBuilder XEM file. 6) Drill down to the attributes of the employee table Note: The LabelFont has a symbol showing that it has been modified.  However, when you try to select the checkbix, it disappears.   In Morpheus, the workaround is to consolidate the XEM without any changes.  Extract the model; modify the extended attribute values and then consolidate the model.

Description :                                    
	 PowerDesigner uses tildas, ~, to suppress quotes on string values for column defaults.  When executing modify database via ODBC, the reversed PDM is compared to production PDM, and default values with tildas, are flagged as being mdofied when no modifications have been made to the default values.  PowerDesigner needs to address the tilda issue when executing modify database via an ODBC data source.  The workaround is to execute modify database via an archived model or to add the string in the default value to the list of default values in the DBMS file.  To reproduce:  1) Generate attached .apm file to database 2) Open attached .pdm file 3) Execute modify database using an ODBC data source and select the table that was just generated. Note: The ACTBEG column will show changes on the default value when no change has been made.

	 When adding columns to a table, the copy and paste of the column attributes do not work correctly.  When you try to paste a value in a new column, the paste action does not take on the first execution of ctrl+v.  To reproduce:  1) Add a table and two columns.  On column_2, set the datatype to char(25) 2) Select the datatype and copy it 3) Click the down arrow ( creating a new column with the current focus on the datatype) 4) Select ctrl+v to paste the datatype Note: The datatype is not pasted, but the cursor is now positioned at the 8th positioned or the character length of the datatype being pasted.  Note: When pasting into the column name, the name field is not updated, but the code of the column is updated.  If you select the datatype a second time an click ctrl+v, then the paste action works.  This works correctly in the CDM.

Looking at the dbms file I see the syntax as   close %s : default=yes, list=yes|no   defer : list=yes|no, default=yes   copy %s : list=yes|no, default=yes  For the defer item, the %s is missing after defer. Making this change resolves the problem. Steps to reproduce.  1. Open a model for  IBM DB2 UDB 6 or 7 for OS/390. 2. Create a table and an index on it. 3. Go to options tab for the index and select close, defer and copy and move them to the right pane. 4. Click on the sql tab and find the value for defer has not be saved.

Description :                              
	 Oracle 9i  Customer has three identical schemas in one database (the user names are different). When a schema is reverse engineered, the attributes of the Abstract Data Type, ADT, objects are reversed in triplicate.  Steps to Reproduce:  1) Using the oracle_obj.sql file, generate the abstract datatypes in oracle database three times under different user names  2) Via ODBC, reverse engineer the ADTs for one of the schemas 3) In The List Of Abstract Data types, open the properties of the "BULK_MD_VALUE_O" ADT and select the attribute tab.

Label  : Merging user-defined trigger templates are defaulting back to the original templ
Description :                      
	 Merging user-defined trigger templates are defaulting back to the original template syntax.  (This was originally reported as a consolidation issue.)  When a local user-defined trigger template has been modified (user-defined trigger template is user-defined), user-defined flag is deselected when the model is merged into another model.  This results in the default user-defined template being reapplied.  To reproduce:  1)Add table_1 and table_2 to a new PDM, Test.PDM, with ASA 8 as the target DBMS 2)Select Model\Trigger\trigger templates - create a new trigger template, myTemplate based on the Before Insert trigger 3) Add the following text or any other code to the trigger definition      -- delete this line in customized code        This is a test      -- this is from the template     -- sample code that will remain in the trigger 4) Add user defined trigger no_delete to table_1.  Associate this trigger with myTemplate 5) Add user defined trigger delete to table_2. Associate this trigger with myTemplate.  Also, delete the following from the trigger definition      -- delete this line in customized code        This is a test 6)Merge Test.PDM into a new PDM, NewTest.PDM targeting ASA8.  Select all actions in the merge screen. 7)Compare the two PDMs.   NOTE: In NewTest.PDM the delete trigger is no longer user defined and the deleted text:      -- delete this line in customized code        This is a test  has been added back.  It appears that once the user-defined option is deselected, the 'myTemplate' default definition is re-instated on the delete trigger.  As a workaround, the local trigger template can be created in the DBMS file.  If this is done, then the modification made to the delete trigger will be maintained when the models are merged.

	 Modify Database script will delete or make views unavailable in DB2 as part of of the Drop Table statement and the views are not recreated.  In UDB 6 OS/390, the drop table statement cascades the delete and drops all dependent objects. In this issue, the customer is concerned about view.  In UDB 7 OS/390, the drop table statement makes the dependent view inoperative. However, the view syntax is still stored in the database.  Link to version 6 documentation: http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/cgi-bin/bookmgr_OS390/BOOKS/dsnag0g3/2.11.6.8.1?SHELF=DSNSH0G4&DT=20010421154551#HDRDB0706 The DROP TABLE statement deletes a table. For example, to drop the project table, execute:        DROP TABLE DSN8610.PROJ; The statement deletes the row in the SYSIBM.SYSTABLES catalog table that contains information about DSN8610.PROJ. It also drops any other objects that depend on the project table. As a result:  The column names of the table are dropped from SYSIBM.SYSCOLUMNS.  Any views based on the table are dropped.   Link to version 7 documentation http://www-3.ibm.com/cgi-bin/db2www/data/db2/udb/winos2unix/support/document.d2w/report?last_page=list.d2w&fn=db2v7d0db2d0116.htm#HDRDROPTAB  A table can be dropped with a DROP TABLE SQL statement.  When a table is dropped, the row in the SYSCAT.TABLES catalog that contains information about that table is dropped, and any other objects that depend on the table are affected. For example:  All column names are dropped.  Indexes created on any columns of the table are dropped.  All views based on the table are marked inoperative.

Turning the new checkbox off would have the following effects: - If the radio buttons are set to always create, it would drop and recreate all modified tables. - If the radio buttons are set to use alter, it would use alters where possible, but otherwise, drop and recreate.  But it would not use temporary tables at all, no matter what. - The last checkbox could still be enabled, but only to clean up temporary tables from a previous run where data preservation was turned on.

The customer has turned off the 'adjust to text' option for all diagrams.  The customer then enlarges a table so that there is ample space for the references.  The customer then creates a new diagram in the same namespace.  Then the customer selects several objects and drag/drop using ctrl+shift+click (shorcut).  The selected objects lose their formatting in the new diagram.

If the customer were using the copy/paste as shortcut option the formatting would be preserved.  This would be the workaround.

Cannot capture column default value in PDM from ASE 12 database after Reverse Engineering

When reverse engineering ASE 12 via ODBC, PD fails to reverse engineer the column default values.	This was reported on closed CR# 207042 which states that this was corrected for script, but makes no reference to ODBC.

ODBC Driver:	PB MERANT OEM 3.60 32-BIT Sybase ASE (coming along with PowerDesigner 8.0)
	PB MERANT OEM 3.70 32-BIT Sybase ASE (coming along with PowerDesigner 9.0)

Steps to Reproduce Problem:

(1)  Create the testing table "test_default" with default value in the column "last_user" in ASE 12 database using either one of the following two approaches:

(a)  Use DEFAULT clause within CREATE TABLE statement:

	create table test_default
	(
		id	char(1)		not null,
		last_user	varchar(10)	default "user1"	null,
		constraint test_default_key primary key clustered (id)
	)
	go
	
(b)  Use CREATE DEFAULT statement to create default value, use CREATE TABLE statement to create the table "test_default", and then bind it the to table column "last_user" with the system stored procedure "sp_bindefault":

	create default user_default as "user1"
	go

	create table test_default
	(
		id	char(1)		not null,
		last_user	varchar(10)	null,
		constraint test_default_key primary key clustered (id)
	)
	go

	sp_bindefault user_default, "test_default.last_user"
	go

(2)  Perform Reverse Engineering on the testing database to generate PDM inside PowerDesigner (selecting File  ->  Reverse Engineer  ->  Database... from menu).

(3)  In the PDM generated, right-click on the table "test_default" and then select "Columns..." from the pop-up menu.  Double-click on the column "last_user" to open the "Column Properties" dialog box.  On the "Standard Checks" tab page, there is not any default value specified.

However, if the column is associated with a domain, the domain default value is reverse engineered.

Label  : Add Diagram Card that includes Author,create & modify dates to a Diagram Card

	 In spirit of adding author, create & modify dates to a Diagram' properities (see cr# 258234), we should allow this information to be in the Report on a Diagram Card.

Customer knows about the object node called "Diagram List" where it  offers [diag. name, diag. code, creation date, creator, modification date, modifier, diagram comment, and annotation].  But, the user feels that a Diagram Card would best serve the user's reporting quality by allowing the following structure:

Diagram_1
  -diagram name/code
  -diagram description/annotation/
  -author/date created/date modified
-tables list in diagram
-reference list in diagram
...
Diagram_2
  -diagram name/cod

Label  : Modify Database (ASA 6) uses the Block Terminator instead of the Terminator
Description :                                       
	 
**** Thu Aug 23 11:08:43 EDT 2001 *** ahill **** build 339 & 8.0.1.275


Modify Database (ASA 6) uses the Block Terminator of "/" instead of the Command Terminator of ";".  

As a workaround you have to edit the DBMS and delete the "/" to force it to use the ";".

	 Sunday, 6/24/01: 
Tested on home pc:  PD 7.5.0.826 /  Access 97 SR-1.
I ran check model and it captured 77 errors with respect to "duplicated constraints"  [table, column, fk_constraints]... I ran auto correct and it appended a sequential # at the end of each constraint name.
In v7.5.0826, I ran the script generation per the PD instructons to the Access 97 database (*.mdb) file.  It ran very well.... 

Monday, 6/25/01: 
Test at work:  PD 7.5.0.826 and PD 8.0.0.203/ Access 2000 (9.0.2720)
In v7.5.0.826,  I ran check model... I get the same results as the check model on my home pc... The 77 errors flagged as duplicated constraints... I auto correct them.
In v7.5.0.826,  I ran the script generation per the PD instructions to the Access 2000 database (*.mdb) file.  It fails!!!
Error messages: 
   Creating table "table_1"   --> Invalid field data type.  <ok>
   Creating table "table_2"   --> Invalid field data type.  <ok>
   Creating table "table_3"   --> Invalid field data type.  <ok>
   Creating table "table_4"   --> Invalid field data type.  <ok>
Then the "Physical Data Model  / Access 2000 window that is created from selecting the "access2k.mdb" file that is found in the PowerDesigner/Tools directory remains open after these error messages fly through... I have to select the <QUIT> button and then in Ms Access 2k open the *.mdb file..

I get the SAME behavior with PD 8.0.0.203...

I reviewed the customer PDM model in both versions (7.5.0.826 or 8.0.0.203)...I am trying to review the issue with " Invalid field data type"...  I see a number of columns that seem to have incorrect data types... I have reviewed the Data Type mappings found in the Microsoft Access 2000 XDB file (access2k.xdb).  

I tried to change the columns assigned to the "NOTE" data type to TEXT.  Regenerate did NOT work.

Action: Need to review Ms Access documentation as to valid data types...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
For the sake of testing:  I ran ODBC GENERATION from within v7.5.0.826 and v8.0.0.203.  to Access 2000 via the Microsoft Access Driver vers. 4.00.5303.01  fn: ODBCJT32.DLL date: 3/27/01

I rec'd improved results!
In v7.5.0.826:  I ran ODBC generation.  I got 17 of the 19 tables and 21 of the 22 references created in the Access 2000 (*.mdb).
In v8.0.0.203:  I  ran ODBC generation. I got 17 of the 19 tables and  "no" references at all created in the Access 2000 (*.mdb).

I ran an ODBC trace and found errors: 
DIAG [37000] [Microsoft][ODBC Microsoft Access Driver] Syntax error in field definition. (-3553) 
DIAG [S0002] [Microsoft][ODBC Microsoft Access Driver] Cannot find table or constraint. (-1305)  

In both instances (db gen via script or odbc) it appears that something in the "Order_Item" table is not correct...

The problem is with parenthesis in the fk constraint -> after ADD (....) but Oracle support the two syntaxes with or without parenthesis and Powerdesigner 6.x, 7 can only  reverse the script without parenthesis .
