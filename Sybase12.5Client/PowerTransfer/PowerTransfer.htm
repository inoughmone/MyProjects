		</p>
		<p><big><b>Overview</b></big></p>
		<p>PowerTransfer is an extension to PowerDesigner to allow the transfer of data 
			into Sybase Adaptive Server Enterprise. &nbsp;The source database can be any 
			ODBC datasource supported by PowerDesigner.&nbsp; The program uses the Sybase 
			bulk copy mechanism for high performance inserts into Sybase ASE. &nbsp;</p>
		<p>The program has been tested with the following data sources: Sybase ASE, Oracle 
			9, Microsoft SQL Server 2000, Microsoft Access<br>
			<br>
		</p>
		<p><big><b>System Requirements</b></big></p>
		<p>In order to install and use PowerTransfer, your system will require:<br>
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
			Sybase PowerDesigner 9.5.2
			<li>
				Sybase Open Client 12.5</li>
		</ul>
		<br>
		<big><b>Installation</b></big><br>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Unzip the distribution file into a temporary directory.<br>
			<li>
			If your system does not have the Microsoft .NET framework installed already, 
			install it by clicking dotnetfx.exe.
			<li>
			Click Setup.exe to install PowerTransfer.
			<li>
				PowerTransfer should be accessible through the PowerDesigner Tools-&gt;Execute 
				Commands menu.<br>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<br>
		<p><big><b>Steps For Copying a Database</b></big><br>
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Before starting, you will need to set up the following:</li>
		</ol>
		<blockquote>
			<ul>
				<li>
					The database in the target ASE should be created and configured to allow bulk 
					operations.</li>
			</ul>
		</blockquote><blockquote> <blockquote> <blockquote> <blockquote> sp_dboption mydatabase,"select 
						into", true</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Configure an ODBC connection to your source database for use by PowerDesigner 
					and PowerTransfer.</li>
			</ul>
		</blockquote><blockquote>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Configure an ODBC connection to the target Sybase ASE for use by PowerDesigner.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</blockquote><blockquote>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Sybase Open Client should be configured for a connection to the target ASE. 
					&nbsp;Use the Sybase Dsedit utility to do this. &nbsp;This connection will be 
					used by PowerTransfer to perform bulk inserts of the data.</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
		</blockquote>
		<ol start="2">
			<li>
				Using PowerDesigner, you will need to create the database on the target ASE:<br>
			</li>
		</ol>
		<blockquote>
			<ul>
				<li>
				Create a physical model of the source database by using the Reverse Engineer 
				feature of PowerDesigner.
				<li>
				Change the Current Database Type of the physical model to Sybase ASE 12.5.
				<li>
				Examine the converted schema and make any changes required.
				<li>
					Connect to the target ASE and generate the database. &nbsp;</li>
			</ul>
			<blockquote>
				<table border="1" width="100%" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
					<tbody>
						<tr>
							<td>NOTE: The database should first be created without indexes and rules. These 
								items should be added after the data has been moved.</td>
						</tr>
					</tbody>
				</table>
			</blockquote></blockquote>
		<ol start="3">
			<li>
			Start PowerTransfer from the Tools-&gt;Execute Commands menu of PowerDesigner.
			<li>
				Connect to the Source and Target database from the <b>Server Login </b>
			tab.
			<li>
				In the <b>Table Copy</b> tab, select the tables you wish to transfer and click 
				the <b>Add </b>
			button to queue up the transfer.
			<li>
			The number of rows in the source table should be listed for each source table.
			<li>
				Click <b>Clear List</b> if you change your mind regarding the tables to be 
				copied.<br>
			<li>
				Click <b>Start Copy</b> to initiate the copy<br>
			</li>
		</ol>
		<br>
		<p><b><big>Server Login Panel<big> </big>
					<br>
				</big>
				<br>
			</b>This panel describes source and target connection settings. &nbsp;The 
			source connection is an ODBC DSN value. &nbsp;The target connection is a Sybase 
			Open Client connection. &nbsp;Use the Sybase Dsedit utility to configure these 
			connections. &nbsp;By default, one connection will be opened to the source and 
			destination. &nbsp;Change the <b>Number of Connections</b> property in the <b>Options
			</b>tab to enable multiple simultaneous transfers through more than one 
			connection.<br>
			<br>
		</p>
		<p><big><b>Table Copy Panel</b></big></p>
		<p>The list on the left shows the table definitions that are defined in the 
			currently open physical model. &nbsp;The name of the physical model is 
			displayed at the top of the table. &nbsp;Click the <b>Load Table List From Active 
				Model </b>button if you change models. &nbsp;By default, only tables are 
			displayed, however views may also be displayed if this option is selected in 
			the <b>Options </b>tab. &nbsp;The tables are listed in an order determined by 
			their primary and foreign key relationships so that tables are listed after 
			their dependencies. &nbsp;It is recommened however that for performance 
			reasons, transfers be performed with no referential integrity applied in the 
			target.<br>
		</p>
		<p>When <b>Start Copy</b> is clicked tables will be transferred in the order they 
			are listed. &nbsp;If multiple connections have been configured, multiple 
			simultaneous transfers will commence and execute in a non-deterministic order.<br>
		</p>
		<p><br>
			<b><big>Options Panel</big></b><br>
		</p>
		<p>Changes to ASE bulk insert and connection properties do not take affect until 
			connections are closed and reopened.<br>
			<br>
		</p>
		<blockquote><b>Rows Per Bulk Insert </b>
			<br>
			This determines the number of rows fetched from the source and pushed to the 
			target in a single bulk operation. &nbsp;Increasing this value uses more memory 
			but increases performance.<br>
			<br>
			<b>Rows Per Commit</b><br>
			This number determines the frequency that a batch commit is sent to an ASE.<br>
			<br>
			<b>Number Of Connections</b><br>
			This number determines the number of connections to be opened to the source and 
			destination servers. &nbsp;More than one connection enables simultaneous 
			transfers.<br>
			<br>
			<b>Packet Size</b><br>
			This option determines the Sybase TDS packet sized used to connect to the 
			target ASE. &nbsp;Larger packet sizes provide better performance, however use 
			more server memory. &nbsp;This option should not be set higher than the maximum 
			configured packet size configured in your target server. &nbsp;The maximum 
			allowed packet size on ASE can be configured using:<br>
			<blockquote> <blockquote>sp_configure "max network packet size",8192<br>
				</blockquote></blockquote>
			<br>
			<b>Truncate Target Table</b><br>
			This checkbox indicates whether a TRUNCATE TABLE statement should be sent to 
			the target at the start of &nbsp;the transfer.<br>
			<br>
			<b>Show Views In Table List</b><br>
			This checkbox determines whether views in the physical model should be listed 
			as a source tables. &nbsp;This option allows a view in the source database to 
			be copied to a table in the target. &nbsp;This can be useful for moving a 
			subset or an aggregation of the source database's data.<br>
			<br>
		</blockquote>
		<br>
		<b><big>Schema Conversion Notes</big></b><br>
		<br>
		<blockquote><b>General</b><br>
			<ul>
				<li>
				Column names may be changed between the source and the target, however the 
				column ordering must be the same.
				<li>
				Table names cannot altered and must be valid names on ASE. &nbsp;
				<li>
					The table owner is assumed to be as described in the PowerDesigner physical 
					model. &nbsp;If you want to have different table owners between the source and 
					target, you can assign the owner in the PowerDesigner physical model to NONE 
					and let the userid default to the id that is used for the ODBC/Open Client 
					connections.<br>
				<li>
				Data types can be different between the source and the target as long as the 
				types are convertable. &nbsp;You may receive overflow errors during a transfer 
				if copying into a smaller sized type.
				<li>
					Use views in the source database if you wish to copy subsets of the source 
					tables or if you wish to alter the table names. &nbsp;The target database 
					should contain an actual table definition that matches the column list of the 
					view.<br>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</blockquote><blockquote><b>Microsoft SQL Server</b><br>
			<ul>
				<li>
				Watch for the identity property being applied to non-numeric datatypes. 
				&nbsp;ASE requires a NUMERIC type for the identity property.
				<li>
					Uncheck "Physical options" in the PowerDesigner database generation panel to 
					avoid "ON PRIMARY" being generated on the CREATE statements generated for ASE.</li>
			</ul>
			<b>Oracle</b><br>
			<ul>
				<li>
					XML and TIMESTAMP datatypes are not supported.</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
