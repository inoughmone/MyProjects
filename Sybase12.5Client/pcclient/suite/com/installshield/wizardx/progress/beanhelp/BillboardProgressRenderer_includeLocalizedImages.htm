<P>The <STRONG>Include Localized Images</STRONG> property enables you to include localized versions of your billboard images. If the specified image(s) should be localized, then set this property to "True". Otherwise, leave this property set to "False" (default).</P>

If set to "True", then ensure that the correctly named localized graphic files are located in the same directory as the default file. A localized image file must comply with the class naming convention pattern described in Sun's API documentation for Resource Bundles (<STRONG>http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.1/docs/api/java/util/ResourceBundle.html</STRONG>), e.g., "billboard_en.gif" (for English), "billboard_es.gif" (for Spanish), etc.</P>
