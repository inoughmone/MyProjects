<P>For most projects, this property should be left blank (the default) so that a message does not flash on the screen before it can be read, which could indicate to the end user that a possible error occurred during installation. However, if the file displayed by this panel is large enough to cause a noticeable delay, then this property should be set by typing the message you want displayed while the file loads.</P>

When this property's value is non-blank, the panel resolves it at runtime, and displays the result in the Wizard UI while the panel loads and initializes. Since this string most likely should be localized, a default string is available in the InstallShield localized resources that can be used that displays the message "Please wait...". To specify that string, enter:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>$L(com.installshield.wizard.i18n.WizardResources, pleaseWait)</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE></P>

You can also use the "$L()" string resolver to specify a string from a resource bundle that you have included in your project.</P>
