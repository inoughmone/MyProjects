<TD STYLE="padding-left: 8pt">If "Drop-down List" is selected, and <STRONG>Selection</STRONG> (property immediately above this one) is set to "Unset", then the first option &mdash; "Approve" &mdash; displays in the drop-down list as preselected when this panel initially displays. Therefore, it is recommended that if a "Drop-down List" is required as the <STRONG>UI Type</STRONG>, then the <STRONG>Selection</STRONG> property should be set to either "Approve" or "Disapprove". If no preset selection is desired (<STRONG>Selection</STRONG> value is "Unset"), then this property should be set to "Radio Buttons".</TD>
