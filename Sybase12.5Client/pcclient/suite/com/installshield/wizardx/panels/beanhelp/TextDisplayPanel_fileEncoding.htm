This property is only used when the <strong>Text Source</strong> property is set
to "Local File" - Otherwise, it is ignored. Specify the Java encoding to be used for
converting the bytes in the local file to a Java String at runtime. If left 
blank, the installer uses the default encoding of the JVM on the target machine.

<P>The encoding must match the encoding that was used to write the file specified in the <strong>File Name</strong> property.
If you have set <strong>Include Localized Files</strong> to "True", then each of the
localized versions of this file must also be saved using the <EM>same file encoding</EM>.

<P>For example, one of the most common encodings is <EM>utf-8</EM>. If your file is encoded in <EM>utf-8</EM> format,
then set this property to "UTF8" (without the double quotes). You must ensure that your installer is executed with a JVM that supports
the encoding you specify. Keep in mind that the set of supported encodings differs not just
by which version of  JVM you are using, but also the JVM vendor and whether or
not the JVM supports internationalization.
