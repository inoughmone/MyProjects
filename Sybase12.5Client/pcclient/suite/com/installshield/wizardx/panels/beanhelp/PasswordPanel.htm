<P>
The <STRONG>Password Panel</STRONG> requests a password entry from the end user. This password is parsed to match the value stored in the <STRONG>Password</STRONG> property of this bean - <EM>It must be an exact match</EM>. If the correct password is entered, the end user can move to the next panel by clicking the <STRONG>Next</STRONG> button. If an invalid password is entered, the end user is prompted to enter a valid password when they press <STRONG>Next</STRONG>.</P>

The <STRONG>Password Panel</STRONG> <EM>cannot</EM> contain calculations - Only strings. If you need to parse 
the password in order to act on it later during the install, you need to create a custom bean (see the <EM><STRONG>MultiPlatform User's Guide</STRONG></EM>, <STRONG>Chapter 6 - Custom Beans</STRONG>).</P>
