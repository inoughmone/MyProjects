The <STRONG>Reboot Panel</STRONG> is responsible for rebooting the end user's system when a reboot is required after installation/uninstallation, and <EM>only</EM> applies to Windows platforms (for Unix platforms, see <STRONG>Logout Panel</STRONG>).</P>

This panel <EM>only</EM> displays when a reboot is required by the Windows OS on the target machine. If the <STRONG>Restart Wizard</STRONG> property is set to "True", then the Wizard restarts at the next Wizard bean in the Wizard Tree upon completion of the reboot.</P>
