<P>If the <STRONG>Text Source</STRONG> property is "Local File", setting this property to "True" causes the panel to include any localized versions of <STRONG>File Name</STRONG> in the archive for use during runtime.</p>

If set to "True", then ensure that the correctly named localized files are located in the same directory as the default file. A localized file must comply with the class naming convention pattern described in Sun's API documentation for Resource Bundles (<STRONG>http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.1/docs/api/java/util/ResourceBundle.html</STRONG>), e.g., "myfile_en.txt" (for English), "myfile_es.txt" (for Spanish), etc.</P>
