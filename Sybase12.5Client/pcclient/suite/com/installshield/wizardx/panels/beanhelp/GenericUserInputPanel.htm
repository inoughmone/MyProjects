The <STRONG>User Input Panel</STRONG> is used to retrieve user input such as name, license key number, email address, URL, etc. It can also be used to validate that the end user is authorized to install the product(s), and/or to obtain the information required to notify them of future patches, upgrades, etc. This bean is extremely flexible and can be customized to obtain any type of information from the end user for use/storage later during the installation/uninstallation.</P>

For example, to validate that the end user is authorized to install the product, add this panel after the <STRONG>Welcome Panel</STRONG> and request authorization information. Then add a <STRONG>User Input Condition</STRONG> to the <STRONG>Install Action</STRONG> bean that requires that it "Must be met".

The user input is stored as an extended property with the key being the <EM>name of the input field</EM>, i.e., input type, that can be retrieved at any point after user input during the installation. The developer sets the name for each input field, each representing a different piece of information that the end user entered, then retrieves the value of each input field using the "$W" string resolution method.</P>

For example:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>$W(beanID.inputFieldName)</CODE></P>

Where:</P>

<EM>beanID</EM> is the bean ID of the <STRONG>User Input Panel</STRONG>, and <EM>inputFieldName</EM> is the value of the <STRONG>Name</STRONG> property, specified by the developer for that input field on the panel.
