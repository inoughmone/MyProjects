The text you want displayed in the panel when it runs. This property is used
only when the <STRONG>Text Source</STRONG> property is set to "Text Property". You can use variables
which will be resolved at runtime with string resolution. String resolution
allows you, for example, to provide localized values for the text by using
the "$L" resolution function.
