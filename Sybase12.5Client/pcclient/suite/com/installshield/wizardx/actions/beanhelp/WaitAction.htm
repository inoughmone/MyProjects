<P>
A <STRONG>Wait Action</STRONG> is a wizard action that pauses for 
a specified amount of time, in seconds, before continuing on to the next Wizard 
bean in the sequence.</P>

This action can be used in a situation where the developer needs to guarantee that 
a process will have had adequate time to complete before the installation/uninstallation continues.
