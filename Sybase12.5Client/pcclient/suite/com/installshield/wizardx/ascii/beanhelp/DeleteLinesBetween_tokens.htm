A list of <STRONG>Tokens</STRONG> to search for sequentially in the ASCII file. The 
<STRONG>Tokens</STRONG> can have other text between them, but they <EM>must come sequentially on the same line</EM>.</P>

For example, if the <STRONG>Tokens</STRONG> 
are</P>
<PRE>
  temp
  =
  c:\temp
</PRE>

then the following line would be found:</P>
<PRE>
  temp = c:\windows\temp;d:\temp;c:\temp;
</PRE>
