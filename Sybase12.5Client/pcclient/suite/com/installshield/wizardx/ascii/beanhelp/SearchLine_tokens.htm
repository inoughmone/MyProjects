<META name="see-also" content="respectCase">

<P>A list of <STRONG>Tokens</STRONG> that will be searched for sequentially in the ASCII file, <EM>all on the same line</EM>. The <STRONG>Tokens</STRONG> can have other text between them, but must come <EM>sequentially</EM> on the same line.</P>

For example, if the <STRONG>Tokens</STRONG> are 'temp', '=', and 'c:\temp', then the following line would be found:</P>

<PRE>
temp = c:\windows\temp;d:\temp;c:\temp;
</PRE>
  
The search for these <STRONG>Tokens</STRONG> is also affected by the <STRONG>Respect Case</STRONG> property setting.</P>
