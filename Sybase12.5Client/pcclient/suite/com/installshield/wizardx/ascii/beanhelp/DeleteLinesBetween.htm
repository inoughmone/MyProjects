The <STRONG>Delete Lines Between</STRONG> action deletes the lines between
the match found by the last <STRONG>Search Line/Text</STRONG> and the next match of the 
<STRONG>Tokens</STRONG> found in the ASCII file.</P>

If the tokens are not found on a line after the 
match found by the last <STRONG>Search Line/Text</STRONG>, then nothing 
is deleted. If the last <STRONG>Search Line/Text</STRONG> found multiple
matches, only the <EM>first</EM> one is used.</P>

If <STRONG>Comment Chars</STRONG> are specified, then comments are excluded from 
the search.</P>
