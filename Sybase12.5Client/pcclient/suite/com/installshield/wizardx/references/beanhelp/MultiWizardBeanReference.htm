A <STRONG>Multi-Wizard Bean Reference</STRONG> is used to visit a wizard bean(s) in one or more installer archives within a <STRONG>Multi-installer Suite</STRONG> installation. This bean differs from a <STRONG>Wizard Bean Reference</STRONG> by enabling the developer to specify more than one archive, and the sequence in which the referenced wizard beans are visited.</P>

For example, this reference can be used to display the <STRONG>Destination Panel</STRONG> for each product in a Suite, allowing the user to modify each product's install location. This presumes, of course, that each <STRONG>Destination Panel</STRONG> has the same <STRONG>Bean ID</STRONG>, e.g., "destination". The <STRONG>Bean ID Reference</STRONG> property would then be set to "destination".</P>

<STRONG>NOTE</STRONG>: A <STRONG>Multi-Wizard Bean Reference</STRONG> does <EM>not</EM> apply to <STRONG>Single-installer Suites</STRONG>.
