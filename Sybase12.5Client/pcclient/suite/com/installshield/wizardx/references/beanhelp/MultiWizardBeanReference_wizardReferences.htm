The <STRONG>Wizard References</STRONG> property enables the developer to specify the wizard archives within the Suite to be searched for the specified <STRONG>Bean ID Reference</STRONG>.</P>

Click the ellipsis ("..."), and a <STRONG>List</STRONG> box displays. Specify the wizard archive file names, i.e., .jar files, one per line, <EM>in the sequence</EM> that the referenced wizard bean should be visited (identified by the <STRONG>Bean ID Reference</STRONG> property).</P>

Enter the .jar file names relative to the current archive's location. For example, to link to the wizards "project1.jar" and "project2.jar" that are located in the <EM>same directory</EM> as the current archive, specify this property as follows:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
project1.jar<BR>
project2.jar
</BLOCKQUOTE>

To link to wizards that are located in a <EM>subdirectory</EM> of the current directory named "old_projects", then specify this property as follows:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
old_projects/project1.jar<BR>
old_projects/project2.jar
</BLOCKQUOTE>
