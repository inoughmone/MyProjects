<P>A <STRONG>Locale Wizard Bean Condition</STRONG> is 
a wizard bean condition that can be used to determine whether or            
not a wizard bean will be visited or skipped based on the locale
of the user's system.</P>
<P>The locale specified by the <STRONG>Locale Wizard Bean Condition</STRONG> 
will be compared to the result of java.util.Locale's 
<STRONG>getDefault</STRONG> method. The Locale property editor allows the user
to specify locales other than the predefined set already included (to do so,
visit the Custom tab of the locale editor).</P>
