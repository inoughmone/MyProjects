<body>

<P>This condition is used to determine whether the Wizard bean is visited or skipped based on the existence of a file or directory within a list of specified files/directories on the target machine. This condition's <STRONG>Immutable</STRONG> property should be set to "True" because a file search can take time and usually needs to be performed only once.</P>
