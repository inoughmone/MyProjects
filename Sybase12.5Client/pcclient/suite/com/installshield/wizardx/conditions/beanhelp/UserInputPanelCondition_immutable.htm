<P>Set the <STRONG>Immutable</STRONG> property to "True" to indicate that the value of this property will <EM>not</EM> change regardless of when it is evaluated. This means that the first time this Condition is evaluated, the result is cached. Anytime thereafter that the Condition is evaluated, the cached result is returned rather than the condition being re-evaluated.</P>

Set this property to "False" to re-evaluate this Condition every time.</P>
