<P><STRONG>User Input Panel</STRONG> conditions are Wizard bean conditions that determine whether the bean is visited or skipped based on the information entered and/or choice made by the end user in a <STRONG>User Input Panel</STRONG>. These conditions are extremely flexible, and can be used, for example, to stop the installation process if the user typed an invalid key or authorization code. In this example, the condition would be added to the <STRONG>Install Action</STRONG> or <STRONG>Wizard Sequence</STRONG> bean that contains the <STRONG>Install Action</STRONG>.</P>
