<P>
A <STRONG>String Comparison Wizard Bean Condition</STRONG> is a wizard bean condition 
that can be used to determine whether or not a wizard bean will be visited or 
skipped based on whether or not the <STRONG>Source</STRONG> matches the <STRONG>Compare
Text</STRONG> using the specified comparison operator.

<p>The <STRONG>Source</STRONG> is compared to the <STRONG>Compare Text</STRONG> using
rules specified by the selected <STRONG>Operation</STRONG>.

<p>The <STRONG>Source</STRONG> and the <STRONG>Compare Text</STRONG> properties
are both resolved using string resolution prior to executing the comparison
operation. This enables the developer
to easily include conditions based on any strings for which a string resolver
is available. Examples of this condition's usefulness include the ability to test
Java system property values such as java.version using $J(java.version) or product
bean properties using the $P string resolver.</p>
