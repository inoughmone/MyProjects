<P>
The value entered for <STRONG>Partition</STRONG> is the partition to check
the file system of.

<P>
The value entered for <STRONG>Partition</STRONG> is passed into File 
Service's getPartitionFormat method.  The result of which is compared 
against the value entered for <STRONG>File System</STRONG> to determine if 
there is a match.
</P>
<P>
A directory path can be entered for this property and the 
<STRONG>Partition</STRONG> will be determined from this path.  This allows 
developers to specify such things as $P(absoluteInstallLocation) in this 
field.  This field must be filled in for the File System Wizard Bean 
Condition to work properly (unlike the File System Product Bean Condition there 
is no default behavior).
