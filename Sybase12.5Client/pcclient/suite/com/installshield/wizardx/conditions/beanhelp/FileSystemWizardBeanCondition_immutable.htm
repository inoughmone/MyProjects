<P>Set the <STRONG>Immutable</STRONG> property to "True" to indicate that the value of this property will <EM>not</EM> change regardless of when it is evaluated. This means that the first time this condition is evaluated, the result is cached. Anytime the condition is evaluated after that, the cached result is returned rather than the condition being re-evaluated. This is the recommended setting for this condition because a file/directory search can take time and usually needs to be performed only once.</P>

<P>Set this property to "False" for this condition to be re-evaluated every time.</P>
